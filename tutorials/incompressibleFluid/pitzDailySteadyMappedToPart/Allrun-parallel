# !!! Smooth interpolative mapping from a coarse to a fine case is not
# available within mapFieldsPar. All current options create fields with step
# changes at the boundaries between coarse source cells. This poor
# initialisation results in a large transient at the start of the part
# simulation. We need a lot of under-relaxation to overcome this. In future, it
# is desired to introduce smooth interpolative mapping, which should resolve
# this issue and the need for additional under-relaxation.
